# K-Quiz

> A web application built using React Router, Tailwind CSS, Express.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

---

## Our Mission

> To help people find new Kpop groups to listen to and learn about the discography of more groups.

---

## What We Aim To Provide

> Users of K-Quiz will be able to find new Kpop artists using our Group Finder form. This form determines Kpop groups that a user might enjoy listening to based on:

1. Genre, Theme, Topic, or Mood.
2. Artists they already listen to
3. A Randomly Chosen Artist
4. Currently Popular Songs

---

## Architecture

> Our frontend will be built using React Router which makes it easy to building multi-page applications with the ability to use SSR, RSC, and Server Actions to make it easy to separate client functions from server functions.

> Our backend is going to use Express.js to validate and sanitize user submitted data, handle our business logic related to finding Kpop Artists, and store data in a PostgreSQL database with the help of Prisma's ORM features.
